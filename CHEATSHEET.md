# jems cheat sheet

Editor key bindings and workflows for the Neovim + LazyVim + Jupyter stack
that `install-lazyvim.sh` (plus the chezmoi'd config) sets up. See
[README.md](README.md) for install instructions.

## Code navigation

The script enables `clangd` and `basedpyright` against LazyVim defaults —
no custom LSP keymaps. The bindings you'll reach for most:

| Action                              | Key                  |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Go to definition                    | `gd`                 |
| Go to declaration                   | `gD`                 |
| References (list usages)            | `gr`                 |
| Implementations                     | `gI`                 |
| Type definition                     | `gy`                 |
| Hover docs                          | `K`                  |
| Signature help (insert mode)        | `<C-k>`              |
| Rename                              | `<leader>cr`         |
| Code action                         | `<leader>ca`         |
| Jump back / forward in nav stack    | `<C-o>` / `<C-i>`    |
| Document symbols (file outline)     | `<leader>ss`         |
| Workspace symbols (project-wide)    | `<leader>sS`         |
| Diagnostics list (Trouble)          | `<leader>xx`         |
| Inlay hints toggle                  | `<leader>uh`         |
| Switch `.cc` ↔ `.h` (clangd)        | `:LspClangdSwitchSourceHeader` |

Project-wide file / text search (Telescope / Snacks picker):

| Action                              | Key                  |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Fuzzy-find files                    | `<leader><space>`    |
| Live grep                           | `<leader>/`          |
| Grep word under cursor              | `<leader>sw`         |
| Recent files                        | `<leader>fr`         |

Sanity check on a new repo: open a source file, then `:LspInfo` (should
list `clangd` or `basedpyright`) and `:checkhealth lsp`.

## Code review (octo.nvim + diffview.nvim)

The chezmoi'd config enables LazyVim's `util.octo` extra (octo.nvim,
wired to the fzf-lua picker) plus `lua/plugins/code-review.lua`
(diffview.nvim). octo authenticates through the `gh` CLI that the
installer provisions — no extra token setup.

**GitHub PR / issue review (octo).** The full flow lives in nvim buffers:

| Action                              | Command / Key        |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| List PRs                            | `:Octo pr list`      |
| List issues                         | `:Octo issue list`   |
| Start a review on the open PR       | `:Octo review start` |
| Add an inline comment (cursor line) | `:Octo comment add`  |
| Add an inline comment (range)       | visual-select, `:Octo comment add` |
| Submit the review (approve / comment / request-changes) | `:Octo review submit` |
| Discard the in-progress review      | `:Octo review discard` |

octo also registers `<leader>g` keymaps from the extra: `<leader>gi` list
issues, `<leader>gI` search issues, `<leader>gp` list PRs, `<leader>gP`
search PRs, `<leader>gr` list repos, `<leader>gS` search. `:Octo` with no
args lists every subcommand.

**Diff / file-history viewer (diffview).** Standalone side-by-side diffs
of any git revision — also the UI octo drops you into during a review.
All under the `<leader>gv` ("view") group, chosen to avoid clashes:
`gd`/`gD` are LSP go-to-definition/declaration (see Code navigation
above) and `<leader>gd`/`<leader>gD` are the fzf-lua git-diff pickers, so
diffview gets its own namespace.

| Action                              | Key                  |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Open diffview (working tree vs HEAD)| `<leader>gvo`        |
| Close diffview                      | `<leader>gvc`        |
| File history of current file        | `<leader>gvh`        |
| File history of the whole branch    | `<leader>gvH`        |

Inside diffview: `<Tab>` / `<S-Tab>` cycle changed files, `g?` shows the
plugin's help. To diff against an arbitrary ref, call the command
directly, e.g. `:DiffviewOpen origin/main...HEAD` or
`:DiffviewOpen HEAD~3`.

## File explorer (mini.files)

The chezmoi'd config enables LazyVim's `editor.mini-files` extra and
rebinds `<leader>e` to it, **replacing the default neo-tree sidebar**.
mini.files is a miller-columns explorer — each directory you descend
into opens as a new floating column to the right, so it looks like
cascading windows rather than a single tree pane. That's the intended
UI, not a misconfiguration.

Open:

| Key            | Opens mini.files at                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `<leader>e`    | directory of the current buffer      |
| `<leader>E`    | current working directory            |
| `<leader>fm`   | LazyVim-detected project root        |

Inside mini.files (defaults from the plugin — verified against
`mini.files.lua` `MiniFiles.config.mappings`):

| Key       | Action                                                |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `l`       | Enter directory / open file (`go_in`)                 |
| `L`       | `go_in_plus` — enter and close the explorer on a file |
| `h` / `H` | Go up one column (`go_out` / `go_out_plus`)           |
| `<BS>`    | Reset focus to the initial directory                  |
| `@`       | Reveal cwd                                            |
| `<` / `>` | Trim columns to the left / right of the focused one   |
| `m`       | Set a bookmark on the focused directory               |
| `'`       | Jump to a bookmark                                    |
| `=`       | Synchronize pending edits to the filesystem           |
| `g?`      | Show help                                             |
| `q`       | Close                                                 |

File manipulation is done by **editing the explorer buffer like text** and
then pressing `=` to commit:

- **Create a file**: open a new line and type the filename, then `=`.
- **Create a directory**: type the name with a trailing `/`, then `=`.
- **Rename**: edit the existing filename text, then `=`.
- **Delete**: delete the line (`dd`), then `=`.
- **Copy / move**: yank a line (`yy`) or cut it (`dd`), paste it in
  another column (`p`), then `=`. mini.files infers copy vs. move from
  whether the original line still exists.

There's no built-in "toggle hidden files" mapping — it's a config option
(`content.filter`); add a custom keymap if you need it.

To switch back to a tree-style sidebar: remove
`lazyvim.plugins.extras.editor.mini-files` from `lazyvim.json` and
delete `lua/plugins/extend-mini-files.lua` (both chezmoi-managed), then
optionally enable `lazyvim.plugins.extras.editor.neo-tree`. Update this
section if you do — it's the cheat sheet for the current setup.

## Jupyter workflow

Open an `.ipynb` file in Neovim and `jupytext.nvim` converts it on the
fly to a hydrogen-style Python buffer (`# %%` cell markers). On `:w` it
saves back to `.ipynb`.

Default molten keymaps (set in the chezmoi'd `lua/plugins/molten.lua`):

| Key            | Action                       |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `<leader>mi`   | Initialize a Jupyter kernel  |
| `<leader>ml`   | Evaluate the current line    |
| `<leader>me`   | Evaluate over a motion       |
| `<leader>mv`   | Evaluate visual selection    |
| `<leader>mr`   | Re-evaluate current cell     |
| `<leader>mo`   | Enter the output window      |
| `<leader>mh`   | Hide output                  |
| `<leader>md`   | Delete cell                  |

### Image rendering

Plots and other image outputs render via `image.nvim`, which needs a
terminal that speaks the Kitty graphics protocol — that means **kitty**,
**wezterm**, **ghostty**, or (on macOS) **iTerm2**. In other terminals
(default Windows Terminal, GNOME Terminal, macOS Terminal.app, etc.)
text output and DataFrames still display fine; only inline image
previews are disabled. Inside tmux you also need `allow-passthrough on`
in `~/.tmux.conf` (the chezmoi'd tmux config sets this).

## PDF viewing (pdfreader.nvim)

Just `nvim file.pdf` — the plugin hooks `BufEnter` on `*.pdf` and renders
the page, so there's no command to run first. Pages are rasterized with
ImageMagick (which shells out to ghostscript) and displayed through
`snacks.image`; `poppler` supplies the page count and the text mode.

| Key | Action                          |
| --- | ------------------------------- |
| `n` | Next page                       |
| `p` | Previous page                   |
| `z` | Zoom in                         |
| `q` | Zoom out (**not** quit)         |
| `e` | Zoom reset                      |

`q` is bound to zoom-out inside a PDF buffer, so use `:q` to close.

If `n` gives you `E486: Pattern not found` instead of turning the page,
pdfreader didn't attach to the buffer and `n` is still Vim's next-match.
Check `:lua print(vim.bo.filetype)` — it should say `pdf`; `markdown`
means `snacks.image` grabbed the file first. See the PDF section in
CLAUDE.md for the two spec settings that prevent this.

| Command                                     | Action                     |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `:PDFReader setViewMode {standard,dark,text}` | Switch render mode       |
| `:PDFReader setPage {n}`                    | Jump to page               |
| `:PDFReader showToc`                        | Table of contents          |
| `:PDFReader addBookmark [{n}][,comment]`    | Bookmark a page            |
| `:PDFReader showBookmarks`                  | Bookmark picker            |
| `:PDFReader showRecentBooks`                | Recently opened PDFs       |
| `:PDFReader redrawPage`                     | Re-render current page     |
| `:PDFReader setAutosave {on,off}`           | Toggle state autosave      |
| `:PDFReader saveState` / `clearState`       | Force save / wipe state    |

`setViewMode dark` inverts to a dark background — the one to use on
white-background papers. `setViewMode text` swaps the rendered page for
`pdftotext` output: no images and layout is approximated with spaces,
but it's searchable, yankable, and works in any terminal (including over
ssh). Text mode returns nothing on scanned PDFs, which have no text
layer to extract.

**Use kitty.** Rendering needs the Kitty graphics protocol *plus* its
unicode-placeholder extension, which anchors images to cells in the text
grid so the terminal clips them correctly. kitty and ghostty support
placeholders; **wezterm does not** (see `placeholders = false` in
snacks' `lua/snacks/image/terminal.lua`). Without them snacks falls back
to absolute positioning and pages get painted over the statusline,
splits, and tabline, with tmux making it worse. That's a terminal
capability gap, not a config error — text mode still behaves fine
everywhere.

Note pdfreader's own `validation.lua` hardcodes a `{ "kitty", "ghostty" }`
allowlist and matches it against `$TERM`, which fails inside tmux
(`$TERM=tmux-256color`) even in kitty. The chezmoi'd
`lua/plugins/pdfreader.lua` overrides that check to delegate to snacks'
terminal detection instead, which handles the tmux passthrough case.

## carbonyl (Chromium-in-the-terminal browser)

`carbonyl URL` renders any web page directly in the terminal (great for
a tmux pane next to nvim). The chezmoi'd bashrc/zshrc aliases the
command to pin `--user-data-dir="$HOME/.local/share/carbonyl-profile"`
so cookies, logins, and history persist across restarts.

Carbonyl v0.0.3 has a **minimal** keymap — no address bar, no tab UI,
no find-on-page. The browser is intentionally close to "headless
Chromium with a TUI viewport." Confirmed bindings (from
`src/input/parser.rs` upstream):

| Key             | Action                                          |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `Ctrl+C`        | Quit (the only quit key — not `Ctrl+Q`)         |
| `Alt+←` / `Alt+→` | Back / forward                                |
| `←` `→` `↑` `↓` | Scroll the page                                 |
| `Tab` / `S-Tab` | Move DOM focus (next / previous link or input)  |
| `Enter`         | Submit form / follow focused link               |
| Typing          | Goes to the focused `<input>` field             |
| Mouse click     | Click links / buttons                           |
| Mouse wheel     | Scroll                                          |

**Not implemented in v0.0.3** despite Chrome-style expectations: `Ctrl+L`
(focus address bar), `Ctrl+T` (new tab), `Ctrl+R` (reload), `Ctrl+F`
(find), `Ctrl+W` (close tab), `Ctrl+Q` (quit). They're either silently
forwarded to the page (most pages don't handle them) or eaten by the
terminal / tmux.

To go to a different URL, **quit with `Ctrl+C` and re-launch** with the
new URL, or click a link on the current page.

Useful flags (append to the alias if you want them default):

| Flag             | Effect                                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--zoom=80`      | Shrink to fit more content in narrow tmux panes              |
| `--fps=30`       | Cap framerate (saves CPU on heavy pages)                     |
| `--bitmap`       | Render text as bitmaps — sharper in kitty/wezterm/ghostty    |
| `--debug`        | Log to console (useful when a page hangs)                    |
| `--user-agent=…` | Any Chromium flag is passed through                          |

**What works**: most modern websites — GitHub, MDN, HN, Reddit, search
engines, dashboards. Cookies persist (via the alias), TOTP / magic-link
auth flows work fine. Mouse interaction is the primary input model.

**What doesn't**: WebAuthn / hardware keys / passkeys, browser
extensions (1Password, Bitwarden), most captchas (reCAPTCHA, Cloudflare
Turnstile). For GitHub specifically, `gh auth login` handles the OAuth
dance outside the browser; carbonyl then just renders the pages.

`vim` keybindings: carbonyl does **not** have them and the project
hasn't shipped a release since Feb 2023. If `j`/`k`/`gg` matter to you,
use `w3m` instead — same tmux-pane workflow but text-only and
configurable via `~/.w3m/keymap`.
